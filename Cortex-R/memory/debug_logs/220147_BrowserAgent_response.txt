I need to install the `browser-use` library to execute browser actions. Since I cannot directly install libraries, I will inform the user about this dependency.
```json
{
  "thought": "The previous tool execution failed because the `browser-use` library is not installed. I cannot install this library myself. I need to inform the user about this dependency and ask them to install it.",
  "call_tool": null
}
```
