  "thought": "The previous attempt to use `browser_use_action` failed because the `browser-use` library is not installed. This means I cannot directly use the `browser_use_action` tool to archive the webpage. I need to find an alternative way to get the HTML content of the page. The `webpage_url_to_raw_text` tool is available and can extract text from a webpage. While it doesn't explicitly save HTML, it might be the closest I can get to fulfilling the request given the tool limitations. I will use `webpage_url_to_raw_text` to get the content of the page.",
