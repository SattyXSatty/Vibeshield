I need to archive the content of the provided URL. Since the `browser-use` library is not installed, I cannot use `browser_use_action`. I will inform the user about this limitation and suggest an alternative if possible, or await further instructions.

```json
{
  "thought": "The previous attempt to use `browser_use_action` failed because the required library (`browser-use`) is not installed. I cannot proceed with archiving the URL using this tool. I need to inform the user about this limitation.",
  "call_tool": null
}
